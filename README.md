# Student Score Prediction

Predicting student exam scores based on study hours and other performance factors using regression models.

## Project Overview

This project uses the "Student Performance Factors" dataset from Kaggle to explore factors affecting student exam scores and build predictive models. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, training linear and polynomial regression models, and evaluation.

### Dataset

Source: [Student Performance Factors on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors)

Features include study hours, attendance, parental involvement, previous scores, sleep hours, extracurricular activities, and more.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

The project uses Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these using pip:

- pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/student-score-prediction.git](https://github.com/your-username/student-score-prediction.git)

   cd student-score-prediction

2. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the project directory.

3. Open and run the Jupyter notebook `Student_Score_Prediction.ipynb`.

## Usage

- Run the notebook to load, clean, analyze, and model the data.
- Visualizations provide insights into feature distributions and relationships.
- Models predict final exam scores and evaluate performance.

## Results

- Linear regression achieved a good fit with an RÂ² around 0.86 on test data.
- Polynomial regression (degree 2) was explored but offered limited improvement.
- Feature selection and handling missing values were key to model accuracy.
